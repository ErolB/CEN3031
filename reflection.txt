CRUD operations are handled by listings.server.routes.js. This file lays out the procedures for creating, reading,
updating, and deleting listings via requests and responses. These functions are called by listings.server.routes.js,
which specifies how different types of HTTP requests to each endpoint are handled. Middleware is used to add
coordinate fields to the listings during some of these procedures. This is defined in coordinates.server.controller.
This middleware allows several functions to use the same procedure without containing any additional code for the
coordinate lookup. The schema for the mongoose model also contains middleware (listingSchema.pre). This automatically
assigns timestamps to each new listing, which means that the developer does not have to manage them manually.
